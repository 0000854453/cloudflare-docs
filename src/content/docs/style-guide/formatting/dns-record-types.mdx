title: DNS record types

---

As a general rule, do not use [monospace](/style-guide/formatting/code-conventions-and-format/#monospace) for DNS record types. Use regular text formatting and write the record type in uppercase.

You may use monospace for clarity when referring to [IPv4 records (known as A records)](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#a-and-aaaa), or when specifying record types in [procedures](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/). However, for most cases, use regular text formatting and restructure the sentences to avoid ambiguity.

Examples:

* A and AAAA records map a domain name to one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
* You can use CNAME records to point to other CNAME records.
* Select `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` as the record **Type**, according to your needs. (Procedure)
