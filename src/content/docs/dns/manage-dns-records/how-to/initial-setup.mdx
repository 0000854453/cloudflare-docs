As explained in the [overview page](/dns/manage-dns-records/), DNS records are essential, as they are used to make your website or application available to visitors and other web services.

## Review DNS records

<Render file="dns-scan-procedure" />

The sections below provide more context around what these records are and aspects to consider when reviewing them.

## Zone apex record

Zone apex refers the domain or subdomain on which the control of DNS records starts.

<Details header="Example 1">
<Example>
DNS management for **example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| A    | `blog`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      | Auto   |

Zone apex: `example.com`

Full record name: `blog.example.com`

</Example>
</ Details>

<Details header="Example 2">
<Example>
DNS management for **sub.example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| A    | `blog`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      | Auto   |

Zone apex: `sub.example.com`

Full record name: `blog.sub.example.com`

</Example>
</ Details>

Usually, the zone apex coincides with the apex domain, as shown in example 1.

<GlossaryDefinition term="apex domain" />

Example 2 refers to [subdomain setups](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/) (also known as subdomain delegation), which are only available to Enterprise plans.
