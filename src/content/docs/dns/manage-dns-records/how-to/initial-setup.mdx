As explained in the [overview page](/dns/manage-dns-records/), DNS records are essential, as they are used to make your website or application available to visitors and other web services.

## Review DNS records

<Render file="dns-scan-procedure" />

The sections below provide more context around what these records are and aspects to consider when reviewing them.

## Zone apex record

Zone apex refers to the domain or subdomain on which the control of DNS records starts.

<Details header="Example 1">
<Example>
DNS management for **example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| A    | `blog`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      | Auto   |

Zone apex: `example.com`

Full record name: `blog.example.com`

</Example>
</ Details>

<Details header="Example 2">
<Example>
DNS management for **sub.example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| A    | `blog`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      | Auto   |

Zone apex: `sub.example.com`

Full record name: `blog.sub.example.com`

</Example>
</ Details>

Usually, the zone apex coincides with the apex domain, as shown in Example 1.

<GlossaryDefinition term="apex domain" />

Example 2 refers to [subdomain delegation](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/), which is only available to Enterprise plans.

When you create a record on the zone apex, you are indicating to Cloudflare where to find the resources that correspond to the domain or subdomain where your zone starts (`example.com` or `sub.example.com`). The zone apex is represented by `@` when [creating or editing a record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

### Record types and where to point them

Usually, the zone apex record makes your domain accessible by visitors. In this case, the necessary record type ([A, AAAA, or CNAME](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution)) and its content will depend on the provider that [hosts](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/#host-your-domain) your website or application.

If you are using Cloudflare Pages, refer to [Custom domains](/pages/configuration/custom-domains/).

If you are using other providers, look for their guidance on how to connect domains managed on external DNS services. Then, make sure you have the records required by your hosting provider on your [DNS records table](/dns/manage-dns-records/#dns-records-table) at Cloudflare.

## Subdomain records

Most subdomains serve a specific purpose within the overall context of your website. For example, `blog.example.com` might be your blog, `support.example.com` could be your customer help portal, and `store.example.com` would be your e-commerce site.

Even if you do not require specific subdomains, you might want to set up at least the `www` subdomain. It will usually point to the same content as what you have on the apex domain (`example.com`) or use a [redirect](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/manage-subdomains/#redirect-a-subdomain-to-the-apex-domain). Having a DNS record on the `www` subdomain helps guarantee that a visitor who types `www.` in front of your domain address on their browser can still find your website or application.

## Email records

Depending on your business needs, you can configure DNS records so that you can:

- use your domain to receive emails
- receive and send emails from your domain
- prevent others from sending emails on your behalf (spoofing)

When you send and receive emails, you can expect to find mail exchange (MX) records and address records (A or AAAA) pointing to IP addresses specified by your SMTP provider.

<Details header="Example">
<Example>
DNS management for **example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| A    | `mail`  | `192.0.2.1`  | DNS Only      | Auto   |
| MX    | `example.com`  | `john.mx.example-server.test [1]`  | DNS Only      | Auto   |

</Example>
</ Details>

For security records that prevent domain spoofing, you can expect to find TXT records for Sender Policy Framework [(SPF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/), DomainKeys Identified Mail [(DKIM)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/), and Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance [(DMARC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/).

<Details header="Example">
<Example>
DNS management for **example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| TXT    | `_dmarc`  | `"v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=...`  | DNS Only      | Auto   |
| TXT    | `*._domainkey`  | `"v=DKIM1; p="`  | DNS Only      | Auto   |
| TXT    | `example.com`  | `"v=spf1 -all"`  | DNS Only      | Auto   |
