**Release notes**

This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

		- **Changes and improvements**:
				- Consumers can now set the tunnel protocol using `warp-cli tunnel protocol set <protocol>`.
				- Extended diagnostics collection time in `warp-diag` to ensure logs are captured reliably.
				- Improved captive portal support by disabling the firewall during captive portal login flows.
				- Improved reliability of connection establishment logic under degraded network conditions.
				- Improved reconnection speed when a Cloudflare server is in a degraded state.
				- Improved captive portal detection on certain public networks.
				- Fixed an issue where admin override displayed an incorrect override end time.
				- Reduced connectivity interruptions on WireGuard include split tunnel configurations.
		- **Known issues**:
				- macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.1 or later.
