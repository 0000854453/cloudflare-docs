	- Fixed an issue to ensure the Cloudflare root certificate (or custom certificate) is installed in the trust store if not already there.
	- Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive during startup.
	- Extended `warp-diag` to collect system profiler firewall state as part of diagnostics.
	- Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive while handling LAN inclusion.
	- Fixed an issue where users were unable to connect with an IPC error message displayed in the UI.
	- Fixed an issue that was preventing proper operation of DNS-over-TLS (DoT) for consumer users.

**Known issues**:
	- macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.1 or later.
