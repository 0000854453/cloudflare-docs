<Description>

Ingest and load real time data streams to R2, using Cloudflare Pipelines.

</Description>

<Plan type="paid" />

Pipelines lets you ingest and load real time dataÂ streams into R2, without managing any infrastructure. You can send data to a Pipeline data via HTTP, or from a Worker. Your Pipeline will handle batching the data, generating compressed JSON files, and delivering the files to an R2 bucket.

Refer to the [get started guide](/pipelines/get-started) to start building with Pipelines.
