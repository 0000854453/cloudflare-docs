D1 allows you to capture exceptions and log errors returned when querying a database. To debug D1, you will use the same tools available when [debugging Workers](/workers/observability/).

## Handle errors

The D1 [client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) returns detailed [error messages](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/#errors).

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute prod-d1-tutorial --remote --command="SELECT * FROM Employees"
```

```sh
 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.70.0 (update available 3.78.12)
--------------------------------------------------------

üåÄ Executing on remote database prod-d1-tutorial <DATABASE_ID>:
üåÄ To execute on your local development database, remove the --remote flag from your wrangler command.

‚úò [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/accounts//d1/database/DATABASE_ID/query) failed.

  no such table: Employees: SQLITE_ERROR [code: 7500]

  If you think this is a bug, please open an issue at:
  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose
```

You can also log or return `e.message` to capture the error message within an `Error` object, as shown below:

```ts
try {
    await db.exec("INSERTZ INTO my_table (name, employees) VALUES ()");
} catch (e: any) {
    console.error({
        message: e.message
    });
}
/*
{
  "message": "D1_EXEC_ERROR: Error in line 1: INSERTZ INTO my_table (name, employees) VALUES (): sql error: near \"INSERTZ\": syntax error in INSERTZ INTO my_table (name, employees) VALUES () at offset 0"
}
*/
```

## View logs

View a stream of live logs from your Worker by using [`wrangler tail`](/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs#view-logs-using-wrangler-tail) or via the [Cloudflare dashboard](/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs#view-logs-from-the-dashboard).

## Report issues

* To report bugs or request features, go to the [Cloudflare Community Forums](https://community.cloudflare.com/c/developers/d1/85).
* To give feedback, go to the [D1 Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev).
* If you are having issues with Wrangler, report issues in the [Wrangler GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose).

You should include as much of the following in any bug report:

* The ID of your database. Use `wrangler d1 list` to match a database name to its ID.
* The query (or queries) you ran when you encountered an issue. Ensure you redact any personally identifying information (PII).
* The Worker code that makes the query, including any calls to `bind()` using the [client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/).
* The full error text, including the content of [`error.cause.message`](#handle-errors).
