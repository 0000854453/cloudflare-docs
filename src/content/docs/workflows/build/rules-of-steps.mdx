A Workflow step is self-contained, individually retriable component of a Workflow. Steps may emit (optional) state that allows a Workflow to persist and continue from that step, even if a Workflow fails due to a network or infrastructure issue. A Workflow is comprised of one or more steps.

### Make your steps granular

TODO - step is a transaction, should be a self-contained logic. If you have multiple API calls, seperate them into their own steps.

### Ensure API calls are idempotent

TODO

### Don't rely on state outside of a step

TODO

### Set sensible retry parameters

TODO

### Name your steps clearly

TODO

### Don't mutate your incoming events
