# Pricing

:::note

Workflows is included in both the Free and Paid [Workers plans](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers).

:::

Workflows pricing is identical to [Workers Standard pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) and are billed on three dimensions:

* **CPU time**: the total amount of compute (measured in milliseconds) consumed by a given Workflow.
* **Requests** (invocations): the number of Workflow invocations. [Subrequests](/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests) made from a Workflow do not incur additional request costs.
* **Storage** (stored state): the total amount of state persisted by your Workflow instances.

A Workflow that is waiting on a response to an API call, paused as a result of calling `step.sleep`, or otherwise idle, does not incur CPU time.

### Storage Usage

Storage is billed using gigabyte-month (GB-month) as the billing metric, identical to [R2](/r2/pricing/#storage-usage) and the [Durable Objects SQL storage](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#sqlite-storage-backend). A GB-month is calculated by averaging the peak storage per day over a billing period (30 days).

* Storage is calculated across all instances, and includes running, errored, sleeping and completed instances.
* By default, instance state is retained for [3 days on the Free plan](/workflows/reference/limits/) and [7 days on the Paid plan](/workflows/reference/limits/).
* When creating a Workflow instance, you can set a shorter state retention period if you do not need to retain state for errored or completed Workflows. 
* Deleting instances via the [Workers API](/workflows/build/workers-api/), [wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/commands/#workflows), REST API or dashboard will free up storage. Note that it may take a few minutes for storage limits to update.

An instance that attempts to store state when your have reached the storage limit on the Free plan will cause a `WorkflowsStorageExceeded` error to be thrown.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Frequently asked questions related to Workflows pricing:

### Are there additional costs for Workflows?

No. Workflows are priced based on the same compute (CPU time) and requests (invocations) as Workers, as well as stored state. 

### Are Workflows available on the [Workers Free](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) plan?

Yes. Workflows shares the same daily Free plan [limits](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) with Workers.

### How do Workflows show up on my bill?

* For CPU time and requests: Workflows will show up as Workers, as they the same CPU time and request SKUs.
* For storage: Workflows will show up as "Workflows - Storage (GB-mo)". 

### Are there any limits to Workflows?

Refer to the published [limits](/workflows/reference/limits/) documentation.
