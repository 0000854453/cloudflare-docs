Workflows expose metrics that allow you to inspect and measure Workflow execution, error rates, steps, and total duration across each (and all) of your Workflows.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) charts are queried from Cloudflareâ€™s [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

Workflows currently export the below metrics:

| Metric                 | GraphQL Field Name        | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read Queries (qps)     | `readQueries`             | The number of read queries issued against a database. This is the raw number of read queries, and is not used for billing.            |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days.

## View metrics in the dashboard

Per-Workflow and instance analytics for Workflows are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a database:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to [**Workers & Pages** > **Workflows**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/workflows).
3. Select a Workflow to view its metrics.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your Workflows via the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same datasets as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

Workflows GraphQL datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID, and includes the `workflowsAdaptive`  and `workflowsAdaptiveGroups` datasets.

### Examples

To query the count (number of workflow invocations) and sum of `wallTime` for a given `$workflowName` between `$datetimeStart` and `$datetimeEnd`, grouping by `date`:

```graphql
{
  viewer {
    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
      wallTime: workflowsAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          datetimeHour_geq: $datetimeStart,
          datetimeHour_leq: $datetimeEnd,
          workflowName: $workflowName
        }
        orderBy: [count_DESC]
      ) {
        count
        sum {
          wallTime
        }
        dimensions {
          date: datetimeHour
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here we are doing the same for `wallTime`, `instanceRuns` and `stepCount` in the same query:

```graphql
{
  viewer {
    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag  }) {
      instanceRuns: workflowsAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          datetimeHour_geq: $datetimeStart
          datetimeHour_leq: $datetimeEnd
          workflowName: $workflowName
          eventType: "WORKFLOW_START"
        }
        orderBy: [count_DESC]
      ) {
        count
        dimensions {
          date: datetimeHour
        }
      }
      stepCount: workflowsAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          datetimeHour_geq: $datetimeStart
          datetimeHour_leq: $datetimeEnd
          workflowName: $workflowName
          eventType: "STEP_START"
        }
        orderBy: [count_DESC]
      ) {
        count
        dimensions {
          date: datetimeHour
        }
      }
      wallTime: workflowsAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          datetimeHour_geq: $datetimeStart
          datetimeHour_leq: $datetimeEnd
          workflowName: $workflowName
        }
        orderBy: [count_DESC]
      ) {
        count
        sum {
          wallTime
        }
        dimensions {
          date: datetimeHour
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here lets query `workflowsAdaptive` for raw data about `$instanceId` between `$datetimeStart` and `$datetimeEnd`:

```
{
  viewer {
    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag  }) {
      workflowsAdaptive(
        limit: 100
        filter: {
          datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
          datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
          instanceId: $instanceId
        }
        orderBy: [datetime_ASC]
      ) {
        datetime
        eventType
        workflowName
        instanceId
        stepName
        stepCount
        wallTime
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### GraphQL query variables

Example values for the query variables:

```json
{
	"accountTag": "fedfa729a5b0ecfd623bca1f9000f0a22",
	"datetimeStart": "2024-10-20T00:00:00Z",
	"datetimeEnd": "2024-10-29T00:00:00Z",
	"workflowName": "shoppingCart",
	"instanceId": "ecc48200-11c4-22a3-b05f-88a3c1c1db81"
}
```

As said above, you can use [introspection](/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/) with your favorite GraphQL client to discover the available fields and types of the Workflows datasets, but here are some of our `workflowsAdaptiveGroups` dimensions:

* date - The date when trigger was triggered
* datetimeFifteenMinutes - The date and time truncated to fifteen minutes
* datetimeFiveMinutes - The date and time truncated to five minutes
* datetimeHour - The date and time truncated to the hour
* datetimeMinute - The date and time truncated to the minute
* eventType - Event type
* instanceId - Instance Id
* stepCount - Step number
* stepName - Step name
* workflowName - Workflow Name

And here's a list of `eventType`s you can filter on:

* WORKFLOW_QUEUED
* ORKFLOW_START
* WORKFLOW_SUCCESS
* WORKFLOW_FAILURE
* WORKFLOW_TERMINATED
* STEP_START
* STEP_SUCCESS
* STEP_FAILURE
* SLEEP_START
* SLEEP_COMPLETE
* ATTEMPT_START
* ATTEMPT_SUCCESS
* ATTEMPT_FAILURE
