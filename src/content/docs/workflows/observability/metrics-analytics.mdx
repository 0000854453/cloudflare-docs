Workflows exposes metrics that allow you to inspect and measure Workflow execution, error rates, steps and total duration across each (and all) of your Workflows.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) charts are queried from Cloudflareâ€™s [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

Workflows currently exports the below metrics:

| Metric                 | GraphQL Field Name        | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read Queries (qps)     | `readQueries`             | The number of read queries issued against a database. This is the raw number of read queries, and is not used for billing.            |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days.

## View metrics in the dashboard

Per-Workflow and instance analytics for Workflows are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a database:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to [**Workers & Pages** > **Workflows**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/workflows).
3. Select a Workflow to view its metrics.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your Workflows via the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same datasets as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

Workflows GraphQL datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID and includes the `workflowsAdaptive`  and `workflowsAdaptiveGroups` datasets.

### Examples

To query the sum of `readQueries`, `writeQueries` for a given `$databaseId`, grouping by `databaseId` and `date`:

```graphql
query {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountId }) {
			d1AnalyticsAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					date_geq: $startDate
					date_leq: $endDate
					databaseId: $databaseId
				}
				orderBy: [date_DESC]
			) {
				sum {
					readQueries
					writeQueries
				}
				dimensions {
					date
					databaseId
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
