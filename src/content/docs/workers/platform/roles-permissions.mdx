When creating a Cloudflare account, you will be given the Super Administrator role. As a Super Administrator, you can invite members to join your account and assign them different roles.

To check the list of members in your account, or to manage roles and permissions, refer to our [Account setup](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/) documentation.

The following roles have permissions not restricted to Cloudflare [Workers](/workers/) but to related developer platform products too. This includes [Pages](/pages/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), [KV](/kv/) and [R2](/r2/). It also provides read access to Zones, [Zone Analytics](/analytics/account-and-zone-analytics/zone-analytics/) and [Page Rules](/rules/).

## Workers roles

Only Super Administrators will be able to assign or remove the following roles from users in their account. They also have all the permissions of a Workers Admin. Scroll to the right to see a full list of permissions for each role.
