Since Birthday Week 2024, we’ve rolled out Workers Builds, our integrated CI/CD for Workers. We’ve been focused on enhancing speed and expanding support for monorepos, adding new features to make your builds faster and more efficient.

- Build Caching: Cache dependencies and build outputs between builds to significantly reduce build times.
- Build Watch Paths: Define paths to exclude from the build process. Perfect for monorepos, where only relevant files need to be rebuilt.
- Check runs:
  Try these new features today to streamline your CI/CD workflows and experience a faster, more optimized build process.
