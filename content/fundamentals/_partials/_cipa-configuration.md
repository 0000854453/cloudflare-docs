To facilitate compliance with CIPA requirements, our product provides a user-friendly configuration option. By clicking on the designated box, administrators can easily enable the minimum filtering policy options needed to achieve CIPA compliance. This includes applying the filter categories mentioned earlier to block access to unwanted or harmful online content. 
It is important to note that while our recommended CIPA compliance rule covers the essential filter categories, CIPA is designed to be flexible, allowing administrators to adjust filtering policies based on local standards and requirements. 
As such, administrators should carefully assess their specific location and user base to determine if additional categories may need to be added or modified to ensure comprehensive protection.
