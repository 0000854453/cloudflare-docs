For example, the following Worker implements the public method `add(a, b)`:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "worker_b"
main = "./src/workerB.js"
```

```js
---
filename: workerB.js
---
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class WorkerB extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async add(a, b) { return a + b; }
}
```

Which the following Worker declares a binding to:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "worker_a"
main = "./src/workerA.js"
services = [
  { binding = "WORKER_B", service = "worker_b" }
]
```

And then calls as an async method:

```js
---
filename: workerA.js
---
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const result = await env.WORKER_B.add(1, 2);
    return new Response(result);
  }
}
```
