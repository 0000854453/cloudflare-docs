# Query a pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL Cluster from Cloudflare Workers

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to use a Cloudflare Worker to consume data from a pgEdge Cloud Postgres database in a three-node distributed multi-master replication cluster optimized with Hyperdrive. pgEdge Cloud distributes your data to the network edge; when optimized with Hyperdrive, data delivery speeds jump dramatically.

In this tutorial we demonstrate how to:

- Deploy a Cloudflare Worker with the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI.
- Create and connect to a pgEdge distributed Postgres cluster.
- Use Cloudflare Wrangler to create a [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/) connection to your pgEdge Postgres database.
- Query your pgEdge Postgres database with a Cloudflare Worker.
- Test your configuration optimizations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, install the following software:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

## 1. Create a Cloudflare Worker

You can use a free Cloudflare account or Cloudflare Workers account to access Hyperdrive. Use `npx` to run the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI, and log in to your Cloudflare account:

`npx wrangler login`

Then, use the following command to create a Cloudflare Worker project:

`npx wrangler init pgedge-worker`

Follow the on-screen prompts, specifying the following answers:

- `Where do you want to create your application?`: Enter: `pgedge`
- `What type of application do you want to create?`: Select ``Hello World Worker`.
- `Do you want to use TypeScript?`: Select `Yes`.
- `Do you want to deploy your application?`: Select `Yes`.

When you're finished responding to prompts, the CLI will deploy the Worker and display a Worker URL similar to:

`https://pgedge-worker.your-name-423.workers.dev`

Then, navigate into the `pgedge` directory, and install the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI in your project:

`cd pgedge`
`npm install wrangler --save-dev`

## 2. Create a pgEdge Cluster

Visit the pgEdge website to sign up for a free pgEdge Designer Edition Cloud account. After signing up, connect to the pgEdge Cloud console, and deploy a 3-node cluster. When the deployment completes, copy the PSQL connection string displayed in the `Get Started` pane to a terminal window, and connect to the Postgres server hosted in pgEdge Cloud.

After connecting, use the following statements to create a table and populate the table with records:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products(id varchar, name varchar, primary key(id));
INSERT INTO products (id, name) VALUES
('1', 'Whisper Quiet Vacuum'),
('2', 'Everlast Lightbulbs'),
('3', 'Magic Sponge Erasers'),
('4', 'EcoFresh Laundry Detergent'),
('5', 'Sunrise Alarm Clock'),
('6', 'Infinity Batteries'),
('7', 'Gleam Window Cleaner'),
('8', 'IronGlide Steam Iron'),
('9', 'Breeze Air Purifier'),
('10', 'QuickFix Super Glue');
```

When you return to the pgEdge console, the `products` table will be listed in the `Start Replication` pane. Select the `Start Replication` button to start replication across the nodes in your cluster.

Navigate to the `Connect to your database` pane, and copy the connection string for the `app` user that is displayed on the `Nearest node` tab. You will need to provide this connection string in the command that creates a Hyperdrive.

## 3. Create a Hyperdrive

Move to a terminal window, and use the following command to [create a Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/get-started/):

`npx wrangler hyperdrive create pgedge --connection-string="pgedge_connection_string"`

When the command completes, it will return information about the Hyperdrive, including the Hyperdrive UUID. Copy the ID, and update the `wrangler.toml` file to include the following information:

```sql
node_compat = true # required for the postgres connection

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "hyperdrive_uuid"
```

## 4. Update the Cloudflare Worker to Query pgEdge

Open the `src/index.ts` file, and update the Worker code to include the following code that:

- Uses Hyperdrive to create a connection with the pgEdge Postgres database.
- Queries the `products` table (created in step 2).
- Returns the result set in a JSON string.

```js
import { Client } from "pg";

export interface Env {
  HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
}

export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    const client = new Client(env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString);
    try {
      await client.connect();
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM products");
      ctx.waitUntil(client.end());
      const items = result.rows.map((row: any) => {
        return { id: row.id, name: row.name };
      });
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ items }), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
      return Response.json({ error: JSON.stringify(e) }, { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

After updating the file, use the following command to deploy your Cloudflare Worker:

`npx wrangler deploy`

When the command completes, the result set includes a URL. Navigate to the URL with your browser or curl to review information about the `products` table.

## 5. Compare System Latency

We tested system latency by using Terraform and a simple `Go` program that issues multiple HTTPS requests to our Cloudflare Worker and recorded the average request latencies. Some of the environments evaluated combine regional TCP connection pooling (via Hyperdrive) with the latency-based DNS routing you get with a pgEdge database. _Latency by Location (in ms)_ improved dramatically when using Hyperdrive and pgEdge nearest node queries:

| Hyperdrive | pgEdge PostgreSQL   | Los Angeles | Salt Lake City | Dallas | Montreal | London |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| `off`      | pgEdge us-east node | 530         | 549            | 331    | 248      | 604    |
| `off`      | pgEdge nearest node | 366         | 388            | 333    | 247      | 210    |
| `on`       | pgEdge us-east node | 88          | 103            | 122    | 71       | 139    |
| `on`       | pgEdge nearest node | 71          | 79             | 103    | 71       | 72     |

The fastest configuration - Hyperdrive with pgEdge's _nearest node_ - improved request latencies for end-users dramatically. Some users (for example, the user in London) experienced latencies that were cut in half (139 ms to 72 ms) when using pgEdge's nearest-node capability.

When used in conjunction with pgEdge Postgres Cloud, Hyperdrive provides a big win.
